# LaTeX_EnglandWales_Templates

I am an English lawyer.

I have been using Microsoft Word my entire life, and I really do not like the distraction that is the typesetting. Worse than that, it doesn't look professional.

Lawyers need to look to the future to stay relevant.

Thank you for joining this project.
