# LaTeX_EnglandWales_Templates

I am an English lawyer.

I have been using Microsoft Word my entire life, and I really do not like the distraction that is the typesetting. Worse than that, it doesn't look professional.

What does LaTeX offer? A plain text way to prepare documents that will be formatted exactly how you tell it to format.

Thank you for joining this project.
